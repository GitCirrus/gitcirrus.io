            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Who is behind this?</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://nevadascout.com" target="blank">Joe Cotton</a>. I've been working with the web for nearly 10 years now, in all areas from design to development to systems administration. I started GitCirrus in January 2017 to make my life easier.</p>

            <h3>How does this make my life easier?</h3>
            <p>Three reasons:</p>
            <p>
                <ol class="reasons">
                    <li>It's <strong>super fast and simple to set up a new website</strong>. Just add your domain, give GitCirrus read access to the repository and we'll handle the rest.</li>
                    <li>There's <strong>no management overhead</strong> required from you. We take care of everything from security patches to server updates.</li>
                    <li>It has a <strong>powerful, feature-rich control panel</strong> that gives you the ability to customise each website deployment and also view traffic stats, configure email forwarding, stream the error logs and much, much more.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
            <p>You get one free website limited to to a maximum 50mb storage and 100mb bandwidth per month.</p>
            <p>Upgrading to a Pro account for $7/month  allows you to create an unlimited number of websites, however you are limited to one "data pack" which is a storage limit of 50gb and 250gb bandwidth to use each month across all of your websites.</p>
            <p>Each additional data pack that you purchase for $7 per month will give you an extra 50gb storage and 250gb bandwidth to use in that month.</p>
            <p>For example, paying $28/month will give you 200gb storage and 1000gb of bandwith to use each month. In reality, you are unlikely to ever need to pay more than $7 per month.</p>

            <h3>What languages/technologies do you support?</h3>
            <p>Right now we only support PHP versions 5.3, 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 on Apache 2.4.</p>
            <p>In the near future we will be adding support for Hack, Ruby, NodeJS and Python.</p>
            <p><strong>You can view all planned and upcoming features on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/LWF3XsPu/gitcirrus-roadmap">GitCirrus Roadmap</a>.</strong></p>

            <h3>Do you provide databases?</h3>
            <p>Not at the moment, but we plan to host MySQL in the near future. In the meantime you'll need to use a 3rd party database hosting solution such as AWS RDS or Compose MySQL (or even just a Digital Ocean VM running MySQL).</p>

            <h3>Do you have an API?</h3>
            <p>Not yet, but we're planning to launch one soon.</p>

            <h3>Can I use a CDN with this?</h3>
            <p>Yes! In fact, we recommend that you do use one as it will significantly reduce your monthly bandwith usage. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> has an excellent (free) CDN that we have been using for years and can strongly recommend.</p>

            <h3>Tell me about the infrastructure</h3>
            <p>That's not technically a question, but here goes...</p>
            <p>GitCirrus is powered by Docker. Each website that you create is launched in a separate container that gets deployed onto the "GitCirrus Grid"&mdash;a fault-tolerant Docker Swarm that runs on a cluster of networked virtual machines hosted by <a href="https://m.do.co/c/43f8cc07935f">Digital Ocean</a>. The infrastructure is largely autonomous and we make use of the Digital Ocean API to automatically spin up and destroy nodes as the overal cluster load varies without human intervention.</p>
            <p>You can view the <a href="https://status.gitcirrus.io">GitCirrus Gird status page</a> to see what the current situation is&mdash;in real time.</p>

            <h3>I have feedback &nbsp; / &nbsp; I want to report a problem!</h3>
            <p>For super-urgent or critical issues please email <a href="mailto:hello@gitcirrus.io">hello@gitcirrus.io</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/GitCirrus">@GitCirrus</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/nevada_scout">@nevada_scout</a>. I'll try to respond quickly, but occasionally I need to sleep.</p>
            <p>If you've found a bug in the GitCirrus control panel or service, please <a href="https://github.com/GitCirrus/GitCirrus/issues">create an issue</a> on GitCirrus' public Github repository and I'll address it as soon as I can!</p>
